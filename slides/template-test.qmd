# Introduction

## Motivation

### Climate-related disastrous extreme events

### Aid policy

-   donor-side: need-governance trade-off [@bourguignon2020[; @bourguignon2022]{.small-cite}]

    -   internal discipline: population -\> leader
    
        -   e.g. political system
        
    -   external discipline: donor -\> leader
    
        -   e.g. implicit conditionality in the mode/channel of delivery [@raschky2012[; @dietrich2013; @knack2014]{.small-cite}]
        
    -   substitution effect between internal/external disciplines

-   recipient-side: control over resources

    -   Design

    -   influence over domestic policy/reforms

    -   e.g., budget support, project-type interventions, etc.

    -   Implementation

        -   technical control over aid resources
        -   e.g. (non-)State channels of delivery

**Aid policy (comprise)** = outcome of the negotiations between donor agencies and recipient governments [@mosley2012[; @swedlund2017]{.small-cite}] on the aid volume *and* delivery/composition

## Research question

**What is the effect of climate-related disasters on the aid policy (compromise)?**

## This Paper

### What I do

-   Suggest an aid policy (compromise) framework to jointly analyze aid volume and composition

-   Use dyadic bilateral ODA development and humanitarian flows in a non-linear setting, w/ non-negative, skewed, and mass at zero data.

-   Adopt a non-parametric multiple event study approach to characterize the dynamic treatment effects (DTE), semi-elasticity

-   Build a global -weighted- multi-hazard exposure index aggregated at the country-year level

### What I find

# Conceptual framework

## Conceptual framework

-   Cross-table design/implementation

-   OR tree/DAG

# Data and descriptive statistics

## Data

### Outcome

-   source: OECD CRS project-level

-   window: report channels since 2004

### Treatment

-   source: EMDAT/GDIS

-   Event window: (i) Under-reporting before 2000, (ii) no geocoded data after 2018

-   Aggregate all the types of disasters at a yearly frequency to build a country-level indicator, Disaster, that takes the value of 1 if country i experienced at least one disaster in year t, and 0 otherwise.

## Descriptive statistics

### Outcome: official Development Assistance (ODA)

-   non-negative, skewed, mass at zero -\> non-linear

-   extensive margin

### Treatment: Disasters

-   Treatment status graph

### Treatment: Disasters

-   Multiple 'on-off' (non-absorbing) treatments

    -   Potential carryover effects ($D_{t-n} \Rightarrow Y_t$)
    
-   Many potential 'always-treated' units

-   Relatively few 'never-treated'

-   Treatment heterogeneity, e.g., sudden-onset vs. slow-onset events

-   Non-binary treatment, cf. hazard intensity/severity

### Treatment: Disaster intensity

-   Follow approach suggested by [@dellmuth2021{.small-cite}]

    -   Link grid-level climate data to geocoded disaster locations at ADM1-level
    
        -   Baseline distribution of gridded daily weather variables (1980-today)
        
        -   Extreme event = daily weather value \> 95th percentile baseline distribution
        
        -   Intensity = frequency of daily extreme events per year
        
        -   Average grid-level yearly intensity measures at ADM1-level disaster location
        
-   Finally, aggregate disaster locations at the country-year level with a (population-)weighted sum

    -   Alternative weighting scheme: grid-level
    
    -   Alternative exposure variable: population density, agricultural land and/or built-up area
    
-   n.b. Similar approach than in other single-hazard studies in climate economics (e.g., 'degree-days')

# Empirical stragegy

## Empirical strategy

I follow a similar approach as [@bettin2025{.small-cite}]

-   Exploit the exogenous nature of disasters

-   Non-parametric event study specification [@dobkin2018{.small-cite}]

    -   flexibly assess the pattern of outcomes relative to the time-to-treatment
    
-   Multiple Dummies On (MDO) approach [@sandler2014a{.small-cite}]

    -   Multiple event-time dummies are taken on at once
    
    -   in a given period can respond to multiple disasters with overlapping effect windows
    
-   Binned endpoints to defined the *effect window* [@schmidheiny2023{.small-cite}]

    -   Assume that treatment effects remain constant outside the chosen t-year window
    
    -   control for both past and future treatments

Main differences

-   Dyadic outcome variables observed each year (donor-recipient-year units)

-   Non-linear setting (Binomial "Logit", PPML)

-   **effect window** as an open interval with

    -   Assume that the effect of disasters does not vanish but remains constant outside the chosen t-year window
    
    -   control for both past and future disasters

### Example: Effect window matrix

*Table*

### Alternative approach

-   DID “binarize and staggerize” [@dechaisemartin2024[; @deryugina2017a]{.small-cite}]

    -   staggered DiD procedure according to first-time of treatment exposure
    
    -   Advantage: no 'carryover' assumption
    
    -   Inconvenient:
    
        -   loss of information (single binary 'first-time' treatment)
        
        -   rely on 'never-treated' groups as controls

### Empirical specification: static

-   Dyadic setting with country-specific treatment

-   Follow [@faye2012[; @arezki2025]{.small-cite}]

$$ODA_{drt} = \delta DIS_{rt} + X'_{drt} \beta + \alpha_{dr} + \epsilon_{drt}$$ $ODA_{drt}$: commitment ODA from donor *d* to recipient *r* at year *t*

$DIS_{rt}$: dummy that takes 1 if country r has any climate-related disasters in year t or the value of the hazard intensity index

$X'_{drt}$: a vector of (i) time-varying donor or recipient specific control variables, such as GDP and population, or (ii) year or donor-year fixed effects

$\alpha_{dr}$: a vector of donor-recipient country pair fixed effects

### Empirical specification: Event study

Timeline

Bar graph: freq obs. (y-axis), year (y-axis)

-   Effect window from $\underline{m} = -5$ to $\overline{m} = 5$.

-   Treatment window: 2001:2018

-   Outcome window: 2004:2023

-   Limit to external validity

-   Relevant period

    -   2008-09: financial crisis (supply constraints)
    
    -   2009-2010: ENSO (increasing demand)

$$Y_{drt} = \sum_{m=\underline{m}}^{\overline{m}} \beta_m 
\mathbb{B}^{m}_{rt} + \sum_{z \in Z} \beta_z X_{Z_{drt}} + \alpha_{dr} + \tau_t + \epsilon_{drt}$$

where $\mathbb{B}^{m}_{rt}$ is the disaster indicator binned at the endpoints, such that:

\$\$ \mathbb{B}\^{m}\_{rt}=

\begin{Bmatrix}
\sum_{k=t+\underline{m}}^{\overline{t_s} + \underline{m}-1} \mathbb{D}^{m}_{rk} & if & m = \underline{m} \\ 
\mathbb{D}^{m}_{rt} & if & \underline{m} < m < \overline{m} \\
\sum_{k=\underline{t_s}-\overline{m}+1}^{t-\overline{m}} \mathbb{D}^{m}_{rk} & if & m = \overline{m}
\end{Bmatrix}

\$\$
