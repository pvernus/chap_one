# Introduction

## Motivation

-   *Frequency and intensity* of climate extremes will *rise*, even at +1.5°C [[@ipcc2023c]]{.small-cite}
-   Already major *losses and damages*, especially in LMICs
-   Allocation/Access to foreign aid for *relief and reconstruction* is a contested issue
-   *Two-level* bargaining game (donor ⟷ leader ⟷ civil society)

::: callout-tip
## Research question

-   **What is the effect of climate-related disastrous extreme events on post-disaster aid delivery?**

-   **Does domestic politics play a role in shaping the international response?**
:::

## This Paper

### What I do

-   Look at the effect of exogenous shocks (disasters) on aid delivery
-   Use *dyadic panel* data of bilateral and multilateral aid flows
-   Build a global measure of *exposure to hazard intensity* at the country-year level
-   Estimate *dynamic* effects through an event study approach
-   Test whether *state-society relations* in recipient country influence aid delivery

### What I find

-   TBC

## Related literature

**Post-disaster foreign aid allocation** [[@yang2008; @david2011; @becerra2014; @arezki2025]]{.small-cite}

::: small-font
-   Look at aid volume and aid *composition*
-   Use a global multi-hazard measure of *physical* exposure
-   Consider recipient's *domestic political economy* factors
:::

**Aid composition** [[@raschky2012; @dietrich2013; @knack2014]]{.small-cite}

::: small-font
-   Estimate *dynamic* effects of exogenous shocks
-   Consider both *design* and *implementation* dimensions
-   Look at the impact on different *types* of aid
:::

## Conceptual framework

-   Mostly donor-centered mechanisms suggested in the empirical literature

::: {style="font-size: 16pt"}
*e.g., perception of needs/capacity, strategic interests, etc.*
:::

-   No/Low domestic agency in the recipient country (most often) assumed

### Domestic politics and Aid policy

-   External discipline: donor ➝ leader [[@bourguignon2022]]{.small-cite}

::: {style="font-size: 16pt"}
*e.g. conditionality in the mode/channel of delivery* [[@raschky2012; @dietrich2013; @knack2014]]{.small-cite}
:::

-   [Internal discipline]{.alert}: population ➝ leader

::: {style="font-size: 16pt"}
*e.g. political system* [[@flores2013; @cole2012]]{.small-cite}

-   Substitution effect between internal/external discipline [[@bourguignon2020]]{.small-cite}

# Data

## Data

### Outcomes

-   *Source*: project-level OECD Creditor Reporting System (CRS), 2000-present

-   Official Development Assistance (ODA) commitments, constant US\$

-   **Design** *(Policy influence)*: co-operation modalities

    -   Debt relief and Budgetary support, core/pooled contributions, project-type interventions

-   **Implementation** *(Technical control)*: channels of delivery

    -   State vs. non-State (NGOs, multilateral, private sector)

-   *Sample*: Top 20 (bilateral/multilateral) donors in humanitarian or development ODA

## Data {#sec-data-treatment}

### Treatment

-   *Source*: EMDAT/GDIS
-   Climate-related hazards [[@ipcc2023c]]{.small-cite}
    -   sudden-onset: wet (heavy rainfall, floods), windy (storms)
    -   slow-onset: dry (droughts), hot (extreme temperature)

[[Time]{.button}](#sec-treatment-time)

[[Geography]{.button}](#sec-treatment-geo)

[[Time x Geography]{.button}](#sec-treatment-status)

## Data

### Treatment: Exposure to hazard intensity

Follow approach suggested by @dellmuth2021

-   Link gridded climate data to ADM1-level geocoded disaster locations
    -   Baseline distribution (1980-today) of grid-level daily weather variables
    -   Extreme event = daily weather value \> 95th percentile baseline distribution
    -   Intensity = frequency of daily extreme events per year
    -   Average grid-level yearly intensity measures at ADM1-level disaster location
-   Finally, aggregate disaster locations at the country-year level with a (population-)weighted sum
-   n.b. Similar approach than in other single-hazard studies in climate econometrics (e.g., 'degree-days')

## Data

Source: the Varieties of Democracy (V-DEM) dataset

### State capacity

-   index by @oreilly2022
-   Four dimensions:
    1.  fiscal capacity,
    2.  a state's control over its territory,
    3.  the rule of law
    4.  the provision of public goods used to support markets
-   Similar as @arezki2025

### Political regime

# Empirical stragegy

## Main challenges for identification

### Treatment

-   Multiple recurring 'on-off' (non-absorbing) events
-   Carryover effects ($D_{t-n} \Rightarrow Y_t$)
-   Non-binary treatment, cf. hazard intensity
-   Treatment heterogeneity, e.g., sudden-onset vs. slow-onset events

### Outcome

-   Non-normal distribution: non-negative, skewed, many zeroes (extensive margin) [[@chen2024]]{.small-cite}

## Indentification strategy {#sec-identification}

Follow a similar approach as @bettin2025

-   Exploit the exogenous nature of disasters
-   Non-parametric event study specification [[@dobkin2018]]{.small-cite}
-   Multiple Dummies On (MDO) approach [[@sandler2014]]{.small-cite}
    -   Multiple event-time dummies are taken on at once
    -   Adapted to overlapping effect windows
-   Binned endpoints to defined the *effect window* [[@schmidheiny2023]]{.small-cite}
    -   Assume constant treatment effects outside the window (stabilization period)
    -   Obs. outside the effect window are considered as controls [[Appendix]{.button}](#sec-effect-window)

## Empirical stragegy

### Empirical specification: Event study (1)

$$Y_{drt} = \sum_{m=\underline{m}}^{\overline{m}} \beta_m 
\mathbb{B}^{m}_{rt} + \sum_{z \in Z} \beta_z X_{Z_{drt}} + \alpha_{dr} + \tau_t + \epsilon_{drt}$$

$Y_{drt}$: (log) ODA commitments from donor *d* to recipient *r* at year *t*

$\mathbb{B}^{m}_{rt}$: the disaster indicator binned at the endpoints $[\underline{m};\overline{m}]$

$X'_{drt}$: donor-year, region-year fixed effects, and recipient-specific linear trends

-   *Potential confounders: global and regional climate dynamics, local land-use changes*

$\alpha_{dr}$: donor-recipient pair fixed effects

$\tau_t$: year fixed effects

# Results

## Baseline results

-   *Not included yet*

## Mechanisms

-   State capacity

-   Domestic political regime

-   State capacity / Political regime

-   (Conflict)

-   (International political alignment)

## Heterogeneity

-   Nature of the disaster:
    -   sudden-onset / slow-onset disasters
    -   hydrological, meteorological, climatological
-   Bilateral/Multilateral donors
-   Recipient income groups
-   Channels of delivery: NGO, Multi., Private

## Robustness checks

### Treatment

-   **Deviation cut-off** (non-linearity assumption): use the 90^th^ or 99^th^ percentiles
-   **Baseline climate** (climate belief assumption): 20-year or 30-year
-   **Weighting scheme**: grid-level

### Outcome

-   **Amount**: ODA disbursements
-   **Proportions**: ODA % of total

### Estimation

-   **Effect window length**: stabilization period
-   **Absorbing treatment**: single first-treated cohorts [[@deryugina2017a]]{.small-cite}, 'largest' treatment cohorts
-   **Estimators**: imputation/counterfactual estimators [[@borusyak2024a; @liu2024a]]{.small-cite}, TWFE PPML
