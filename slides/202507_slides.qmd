# Introduction

## Motivation

-   Major *losses and damages* due to climate-related extreme events, especially in LMICs [[@ipcc2023c]]{.small-cite}
-   Lack of coordination between relief (*humanitarian*) and reconstruction (*development*) efforts
-   Decisions on the recipient, the amount, but also on the *delivery channel*
-   Potential detrimental impacts on recipient aid *ownership*

## Research question

-   **How do climate-related disasters affect the choice of aid channel of delivery?**
:::

## This Paper

### What I do

-   *Goal*: examine the impact of exogenous shocks due to climate extremes
-   *Outcome*: use *dyadic* donor-recipient panel aid data, disagg. by channel of delivery
-   *Treatment*: build a country-level *physical* exposure measure of hazard intensity
-   *Method*: estimate *dynamic* effects through a multiple event study approach

### What I find (*to be completed*)

-   Climate-disasters increase development ODA across channels
-   Shorter effect on non-State channels compared to State channels
-   *Effect on humanitarian ODA*
-   *Effect on humanitarian ODA by channel*

## Related literature

**Dynamic response of foreign aid to disasters** [[@yang2008; @david2011; @becerra2014; @arezki2025]]{.small-cite}

-   Disaggregate aid by *delivery* channels
-   Use a global *multi*-hazard measure of *physical* exposure

**Strategic choice of aid instruments** [[@raschky2012; @dietrich2013; @knack2014]]{.small-cite}

-   Estimate *dynamic* effects of exogenous shocks
-   Differentiate between *types* (humanitarian and development)

# Data

## Data

### Outcomes

-   *Source*: project-level OECD Creditor Reporting System (CRS), 2000-present

-   *Sample*: Top 20 (bilateral/multilateral) donors

-   *Quantity*: Official Development Assistance (ODA) commitments, constant USD

-   *Type*: humanitarian and development ODA

-   *Variables*:

    -   ODA commitments through State channels: $log(Y_{State}+0.01)$
    -   ODA commitments through non-State channels: $log(Y_{Non-State}+0.01)$

## Data {#sec-data-treatment}

### Treatment

-   *Source*: EMDAT/GDIS , ERA-5, Landscan, and MODIS

-   *Sample*: all ODA-recipient countries affected by a disaster between 2001 and 2018

-   *Measure*: follow approach by @dellmuth2021

    -   global measure of *exposure to hazard intensity* at the country-year level
    
    -   *Hazards*: wet (floods), wind (storms), dry (droughts), hot (extr. temperature)
    -   *Hazard intensity*: annual average # of daily extreme events in regions affected by a disaster
    -   *Extreme event*: daily weather value > 95th percentile baseline distribution (1980-2000)
    -   Aggregated at the country-level (population-weighted sum)

# Empirical stragegy

## Identification strategy {#sec-identification}

Main challenges

-   Multiple recurring 'on-off' (non-absorbing) events [[Treatment status]{.button}](#sec-treatment-status)
-   Carryover effects ($D_{t-n} \Rightarrow Y_t$)
-   Non-binary treatment (hazard intensity)

Follow a similar approach as @bettin2025

-   Exploit the exogenous nature of disasters
-   Non-parametric *event study* specification [[@dobkin2018]]{.small-cite}
-   *Multiple Dummies On (MDO)* approach [[@sandler2014]]{.small-cite}
    -   Multiple event-time dummies at once to allow overlapping effect windows
-   Binned endpoints to define the *effect window* [[@schmidheiny2023]]{.small-cite}
    -   Assume constant treatment effects outside the window, with outside obs. considered as controls

## Empirical stragegy

### Empirical specification: Event study (1)

$$Y_{drt} = \sum_{m=\underline{m}}^{\overline{m}} \beta_m 
\mathbb{B}^{m}_{rt} + \sum_{z \in Z} \beta_z X_{Z_{drt}} + \alpha_{dr} + \tau_t + \epsilon_{drt}$$

$Y_{drt}$: log-ODA commitments from donor *d* to recipient *r* at year *t*

$\mathbb{B}^{m}_{rt}$: continuous disaster indicator binned at the endpoints $[\underline{m};\overline{m}]$

$X'_{drt}$: donor-year, region-year fixed effects, and recipient-specific linear trends

-   *Potential confounders: global and regional climate dynamics, local land-use changes*

$\alpha_{dr}$: donor-recipient pair fixed effects

$\tau_t$: year fixed effects

# Results

## Baseline results

-   *To be included*

-   *Panel A: ES graph, estimates grouped by channels, facet by type (hum/dev)*

-   ...

## Next steps

-   *Specification*: replace country linear trends by appropriate covariates

-   *Robustness*: complement w/ parametric event studies?

-   *Non-linear setting*: MDO GLM (PPML and/or Logit)? [[@chen2024]]{.small-cite}

-   *Heterogeneity*: non-State channels (NGOs, Private sector, Multilateral), donors, recipients, treatment

-   *Mechanisms*: consider recipient-side factors (ex: leader strategic behavior, domestic politics)
